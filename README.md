# doSumn
DoSumn is a summarizer for Information Technology scientific articles written in Indonesian using SVM(main.py) and Textrank(rank.py). The result is displayed on a web page built with Flask (please refer to app.py).
For demo purposes, execute born.py to train the model and classify, and have app.py connected to born.py instead of main.py.
